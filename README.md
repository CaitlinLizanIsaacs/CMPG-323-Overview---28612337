# CMPG-323-Overview---28612337

Agile and Scrum repository will be created to keep track of all work.
This Repository counts as Project 1, to create an effective time managment schedule and to keep track everything.

## What repositories will be created throughout my CMPG-323 journay?

Well five repositories will be in existence for this module, namely:
- CMPG-323-Overview reposiory, Agile & Scrum: Project 1
This project allowed me to develop a time management skill in such a sense that it helped me understand why it is being used in the corporate world.
- CMPG-323-API Development repository: Project 2
My first API was a very humbling learning experience
- CMPG-323-Standards & Patterns repository: Project 3
Finding different ways to code and making code reusuable 
- CMPG-323-Testing & RPA repository: Project 4
      Testing and RPA focuses on collecting data from web applications to access if it passess all tests to work and how its suppose to work 
- CMPG-323-Repporting & Monitoring: Project 5 
      Project 5 is based on Data Visualization, we took data and made a professional looking report based on the devices. Reporting and Monitoring is an analytical           part of this module, which really focuses on gathering statistics on devices.

## Explain branching strategy to be used within each project.
Each project will have the exact same branching strategy which will be the simple Github Flow branching strategy. Which will include everything stemming from the main branch and distributed to adjacent branches that will be created by me, commits will be made directly to the main branch and furthermore adjoining branches will follow.

## Explain use of a .gitgnore file within each project.
.gitgnore file for each project will consist of an ignored file. When we start coding with Visual studio and .NET Core we will receive a .gitgnore file with each project indicating what to ignore within the project folder. This will be rooted be rooted at our various project repos.

## Explain the storage of credentials and sensitive information.
Credentials and sensitive information will be cached in git.
